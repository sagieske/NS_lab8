Outline of Program:

- MAIN:
	set up all global variables
	set up sockets
	set up neighbours via Ping

	while program is running (update)
		check for messages received by multicast
			-> Process Received Messages (multicast)
		check for messages received by peer
			-> Process Received Messages (peer)

		check for commands
			- Ping
				-> send a multicast ping message
			- List
				-> Lists  all known neighbors (those who responded to the ping), with (x,y)	positon	and	IP:port	address 
			- Move
				-> Moves the node by choosing a new position randomly. 
			- Echo
				-> send initial wave with sequence 0 (SEND ECHO)

- PROCESS RECEIVED MESSAGES (multicast)
	If in range:
		-> send PONG

- PROCESS RECEIVED MESSAGES (peer)
PONG:
	If message = PONG
		-> add neighbor

ECHO:
	If message = ECHO
		If first time:
			If Only One neighbor:
				-> Send ECHO_REPLY
			Else:		
				-> Wave further ?with sequence +1? (SEND ECHO)
		If second time:
				-> Send ECHO_REPLY
	If message = ECHO REPLY
			Increment received echo counter
			If received echo count is same as nr of neigbors:
				If node is initiator:	
					Deccide Event
				Else:
					ECHO REPLY to father
